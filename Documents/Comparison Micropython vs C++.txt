Micropython:
- Use when sensors are SPI/I2C
- Easier to develop
- Slow control loops
- No time dependency

Steps for use:
- “PyMakr” (by Pycom) or “MicroPico” extensions for VS code
- Flash the ucontroller with the latest firmware
- Open a serial REPL
- Hard to debug (There’s no full source-level debugger like in C++)

C++:
- Fast operations
- PWM output control

Steps for use:
- Required tools:
   - CMake
   - ARM GCC (arm-none-eabi-gcc)
   - pico-sdk (clone from GitHub)
- C/C++” (Microsoft), “CMake Tools” extensions
- Open the pico-sdk example folder or your project folder with a CMakeLists.txt; The CMake Tools extension handles builds
- Real debugging
